Simulation of the movement of a simple pendulum and of the Foucault pendulum made in Python for a physics class.

In my third year of my engineering school (out of five), my group and I were asked to make a report about the Coriolis effect and include a simulation of the Foucault 
pendulum with the requirement that the simulation is made in Python.

The group is made of 6 people. Among these, William and I took care of the simulation while the report was evenly shared among the remaining members. 
The report made is also in the git folder. 

The requirements for the simulation were the following :
- Have to be able to change the parameters of the simulation
- Show into plots the results of the simulation

Functionality we added :
- We added to the simulation by adding the cases where air resistance is added and the case where there is no Coriolis Force but air resistance is considered null
- We made a graphic interface for choosing the wanted parameters for the simulation

What we also wanted to add but didn't have time to do so :
- Animation that showcase each of the simulation in a similar fashion as they would play out in real life
